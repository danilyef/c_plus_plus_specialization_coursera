### Programming Assignment: Transport Directory, Part B

Implement the second version of the task with the following changes.

The database now contains data on the actual measured road distance between stops.

**Stop X (Changes in the stop addition query)**  
The new format for the stop addition query is:  
**Stop X: latitude, longitude, D1m to stop1, D2m to stop2, ...**  

That is, now after the latitude and longitude, a list of distances from this stop to neighboring stops can follow. By default, it is assumed that the distance from X to stop# is the same as the distance from stop# to X, unless the distance from stop# to X is explicitly specified during the addition of stop#.

It is guaranteed that each of the stops stop# is defined in some Stop query.  
Within a single Stop query, all stop# are distinct, and their number does not exceed 100.  

All Di are positive integers, each of which does not exceed 1,000,000 and is not less than the straight-line distance between the corresponding stops. After each distance, the letter "m" must follow.

**Bus X (Changes in the bus information query)**  
The new format for the bus information query response is:  
**Bus X: R stops on route, U unique stops, L route length, C curvature**  

Now, L is calculated using road distance rather than geographical coordinates.

C (curvature) is the ratio of the route length calculated using road distance (new L) to the route length calculated using geographical distance (L from the previous versions of the task). Thus, C is a real number greater than one. It can only be equal to one if the bus travels between stops along the shortest path (in which case itâ€™s more like a helicopter), and less than one can only occur due to teleportation or chord tunnels.

It is guaranteed that for any two neighboring stops on any route, the road distance between them is provided in some way.
