# C++ Development Fundamentals: Black Belt

![image](img.jpg)

First, the *Black Belt* course will cover topics essential for a complete understanding of C++, including virtual method tables, virtual destructors, undefined behavior, variadic templates, and forwarding references.  

Second, we will give you the opportunity to work with libraries and tools that are indispensable for modern C++ development, such as sanitizers and protobuf.  

Finally, the *Black Belt* course will feature a large project that, unlike previous ones lasting just a week, will span a full three weeks this time.  

By completing our specialization, participants should be able to:  
- Independently solve practical problems using C++;  
- Apply C++ idioms and constructs naturally (STL, RAII, const-correctness, type safety);  
- Find answers to their questions on their own and deepen their knowledge of the language;  
- Write efficient C++ code without compromising readability and maintainability.  

The final project of the *Black Belt* course is designed to assess whether participants have achieved these goals.
